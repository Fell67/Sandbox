# Gift Exchange
This program simulates people drawing names from a hat in order to determine who they are exchanging a gift with. The user enters how many people are participating and the first and last name of each person. The program will then match everyone with the person they are going to get a gift for and then print the results. The results are printed to a single file, one file per person, or directly to the console.

## File structure
The repository is separated out into different folders. Each folder contains the same program but in a different programming language. The functionality between the different programs is the same except for when the limitations of that language will not allow it or it would be extremely difficult to implement. If any deltas between the programs exist it will be documented below. 
### Currently Written in
* C
* Python

### Deltas between the functionality
* The C program currently does not support first or last names with spaces.

## Upcoming features (not currently ranked)
* user is able to add names of people a person can not be matched with (ie John Smith cannot be matched with Jane Smith)
* create a UI for the program
* email participants with who they where paired with
* allow users to send a wish list to who they were paired with
* include a price limit in communications to the participants if one exists
* allow for names to have spaces (C program only)
